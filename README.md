# Pathos

Pathos is a Greek word which means suffering, experience or emotion. It is also one of the 3 modes of persuasion in which
one appeals to their audiences emotions. If you have ever tried to take something you've learned in a coding tutorial and apply it
in a real world scenario you know the suffering and experience I'm talking about. I got tired of tutorials leaving
out the details about managing multiple environments so I wrote "The 12 Labours of a .NET Dev" to bridge the gap from tutorial to production.
I found the 12 Labours of Hercules a fitting analogy to this struggle hence the name of my tutorial series and as Hercules' labours
made him the perfect embodiment of the Greek's idea of Pathos I chose Pathos as a project name.
